1. **Equilateral Triangle Properties:** An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles of 60 degrees.  The height of an equilateral triangle divides it into two 30-60-90 right triangles.

2. **30-60-90 Triangle Properties:** The sides of a 30-60-90 triangle are in the ratio of 1:√3:2. Since the side length of the equilateral triangle is 6, the height of the triangle is 3√3. The radius of the inscribed circle is equal to 1/3 of the height, so the radius of the inscribed circle is √3.

3. **Area of a Circle:** The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where r is the radius.  Substituting √3 for r, we get $A = \pi (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3\pi$.

4. **Final Answer:** Since the circle is inscribed in the equilateral triangle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the height of the triangle, which is 3√3.  Therefore, the radius of the circle is (3√3)/2, and the area of the circle is $\pi (\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \frac{27\pi}{4}$, which is equivalent to .",Geometry and Trigonometry,Hard

Adding the left-hand side of the first equation and the left-hand side of the second equation yields \(3x + 2y + (x - y) = 4x + y\). Adding the right-hand sides of the two equations yields \(10 + 1 = 11\). Thus, \(4x + y = 11\).  We can rewrite the first equation as \(x = \frac{10 - 2y}{3}\). Substituting this into the equation \(4x + y = 11\) gives \(4(\frac{10 - 2y}{3}) + y = 11\). Simplifying, we have \(\frac{40 - 8y}{3} + y = 11\), or \(\frac{40 - 8y + 3y}{3} = 11\), or \(\frac{40 - 5y}{3} = 11\).  Multiplying both sides by 3 gives \(40 - 5y = 33\).
