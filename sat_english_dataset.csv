Choice D uses a semicolon to connect the two sentences, which is not the best choice because a semicolon is generally used to connect related independent clauses, but the two sentences in this case are not independent clauses.  Choice B creates the most logical and grammatically correct connection between the two sentences.",Standard English Conventions,Medium
